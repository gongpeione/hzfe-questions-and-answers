## What is the DOM and BOM in JavaScript?
`The Browser Object Model` is a larger representation of everything provided by the browser including the current document, location, history, frames, and any other functionality the browser may expose to JavaScript. `The Browser Object Model` is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

`The Document Object Model` is standardized and is specific to current HTML document. It is exposed by `the Browser Object Model` (i.e., DOM is a subset of BOM).

`ECMAScript` was originally designed to be a Web scripting language, providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture. `ECMAScript can provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host environments`, and therefore the core scripting language is specified in this document apart from any particular host environment.
